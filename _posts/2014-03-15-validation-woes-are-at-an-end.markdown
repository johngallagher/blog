I'm sick of writing Javascript form validations.

I'm also sick of having to duplicate client side and server side code just to validate some freaking fields on a form.

If you are too, check out [Parsley](http://parsleyjs.org/).

The most exciting thing for me here is [the remote feature](http://parsleyjs.org/doc/index.html#remote) which allows a developer to hold all validation code server side.

[Parsley](http://parsleyjs.org/) also has, rather helpfully, [validations for most common fields](http://parsleyjs.org/doc/index.html#validators).

Finally - one place for validation rules! Most excellent.
